# KP Cratefiller

Made into a mod by Cat Harsis.
This branch is not in the workshop. For that version see [the 1.2 branch](https://github.com/TACHarsis/KP-Cratefiller/blob/KPCF-v1.2.0) or go directly to the [mod as a workshop item](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2869863861).

## Description

You can spawn and delete defined crates, fill these crates and also other objects with defined items.

* Own config file for several things (base and spawn object, working radius, crates and available items)
* Spawn and delete defined crates
* Generated selection of magazines and attachments for a pre selected weapon
* Generated item lists
* Easy management of large amounts of supplies
* Overview of the present object inventory
* Export and import function for inventories

## How to use

It's a mod! This branch has to be built manually, tho. [You can get the 1.2 branch from the Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2869863861), though. See [1.2 Branch](https://github.com/TACHarsis/KP-Cratefiller/blob/KPCF-v1.2.0) for more information
Check the Addon Options to set it up to your liking.

## How to use with KP Liberation

Just load it with the preset. 
The mod does not respect the arsenal whitelist of KP Liberation (neither did the script) and you will have to that manually via whitelist/blacklist in the Addon Settings.

## For Support join the Killah Potatoes discord and move in the `#kpcf`channel.

This is not an official KP mod, so don't expect them to help you with problems or features introduced by this fork. I do hang out there, tho, and will help where I can.
