## How to use

It's a mod! Either you know how to build it yourself or you can just [get it from the Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2869863861).
Check the Addon Options to set it up to your liking.

## How to use with KP Liberation

Just load it with the preset. 
The mod does not respect the arsenal whitelist of KP Liberation (neither did the script) and you will have to that manually via whitelist/blacklist in the Addon Settings.

## For Support join the Killah Potatoes discord and move in the `#kpcf`channel.

This is not an official KP mod, so don't expect them to help you with problems or features introduced by this fork. I do hang out there, tho, and will help where I can.
